List of comments and suggestions:

1 - The ImportAndPrintData method's argument contained an incorrect file path to the data file, I changed it to the correct one.

2 - I introduced a conditional statement that skips empty lines to the loop responsible for importing lines of data from the .csv file, as these were causing an IndexOutOfRange error or unnecessarily occupying space and program execution time.

3 - In the same loop, I added another conditional statement that fills empty fields of records with a string value of "", allowing the program to also include these incomplete lines of data.

4 - I changed the terminating condition operator of the same loop from <= to < to avoid fetching the last empty lines in the code, as it would result in an IndexOutOfRange error.

5 - I removed unnecessary initialization of a single empty object for the ImportedObjects list because it unnecessarily occupied memory and caused problems when the data clearing loop tried to read that object.

6 - I refactored the ImportedObject class to have its properties and fields follow the same convention - for example, one property had its get and set declared on the line below, while another in the same line, so I simply standardized it.

7 - I merged conditional statements in the DataReader class that were unnecessarily nested and required only a logical AND condition in the parent if statement. This improves code readability.

8 - I added the ToUpper() method to ParentType to avoid calling this method multiple times later in comparisons.

9 - I added a string extension method that cleans and corrects imported data lines so that it can be used instead of copying the same code multiple times as was the case in the "clear and correct imported data" foreach loop.

10 - I moved the functionality of the foreach loop responsible for correcting and cleaning data lines to the loop that reads and writes these data to objects. This optimizes the code by removing one unnecessary loop.

11 - I changed the names of the ImportedObjects, impObj variables to objectList and obj respectively, to differentiate these names as they can be confusing, and to follow the naming convention where local variables are named using lowerCamelCase.

Additionally, I would suggest changing IsNullable property to a boolean type because it would provide additional data validation in case any record has an IsNullable field that does not fit either True or False. This causes problems because the database receives potentially faulty records that may contain incorrect IsNullable values (for example, hypothetically a field with the value "trrrrrue"). Moreover, boolean is simply a much lighter type than string in terms of memory usage, which also needs to be taken into account. I did not make this change myself because I do not know how to handle records where the IsNullable field is, for example, empty - as if I should treat them as true or false.
The same goes for ParentType and DataType properties, these variables could also be of a different type than string, for example, an enum, where we similarly eliminate possible inconsistencies in the database and use a less resource-intensive data type.
